	  tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses
          tunnelling and encryption to create a secure private network
          between hosts on the Internet. tinc is Free Software and
          licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or
          later. Because the VPN appears to the IP level network code
          as a normal network device, there is no need to adapt any
          existing software. This allows VPN sites to share
          information with each other over the Internet without
          exposing any information to others.
